AI Chess Analysis Project

This is a repository for an eventual AI Chess Analysis website. Users will be able to insert their own chess games through their Chess.com account or PGNs, and through our system, they will be able to receive tailored pieces of advice for each move. Based on their weaknesses, our software can provide puzzles that can either aid in amending repeated mistakes and critical errors, or more complicated and unobvious inaccuracies. 

Users will also be able to study openings, aiming towards the repeated, practiced openings of the user. For example, if a user prefers to use the London System, our website will detect this from their uploaded games, and provide the respective tips and tricks for the opening. Users can chose to transpose their openings as they analyze, helping those who wish to broad their opening database.

We aim to provide a deeper, more humanistic analysis to chess beginners and intermediates alike compared to the rigid analysis engines provided by StockFish, Leela, AlphaZero, etc.
